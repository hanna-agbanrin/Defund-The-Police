### Black Twitter as a Digital Counterpublic 
Hashtags such as #BLM #SayHerName #ICan’tBreath and #OscarsSoWhite have notably been mobilized within what is colloquially referred to as Black Twitter. Black Twitter refers to “a collective of active, primarily African-American Twitter users who have created a virtual community ... [and are] proving adept at bringing about a wide range of sociopolitical changes”(Jones 2013). Black Twitter most specifically refers to the way in which users, most of whom are African-American interact on Twitter around issues mostly focused on race and popular culture. Black Twitter has been heralded over the past few years as the “new railroad underground” (Jones 2013) for African Americans, “a merciless watchdog for problematic behavior” (Wheeler 2019) for its mobilizing potential: this online space has enabled users to rally behind essential causes, bringing awareness to specific social issues, and call out problematic behaviors. 

Hill has argued that Black Twitter constitutes “a digital counterpublic” that he defines as a “digitally networked community in which members actively resist hegemonic power, contest majoritarian narratives, engage in critical dialogues, or negotiate oppositional identities”. According to him, ​​as a digital counterpublic, Black Twitter has “enabled critical pedagogy, political organizing, and both symbolic and material forms of resistance to anti-Black state violence within the United States” among predominantly African American users. Notably, with the raise of #BlackLivesMatter, Black Twitter has provided an online space that has enabled African Americans communities to bypass mainstream media outlets, “digitally capture everyday interactions with law enforcement” (Hill p.287), and collectively organize around police violence. Within this “digital counter-public” (p.290), BLM disseminated “non-dominant narratives” (Mundt 2018, p.10) “about police brutality and Black liberation” (Mundt 2018, p.1)  Social media and hashtags have been key in the dissemination process, by acting as “collective action frames” (Ray & Brown 2017, p.1799) which link together “events of police brutality” by “locating texts, videos and pictures within a specific conversation” (Bonilla & Rosa 2015, p.5). 

The pedagogical aspect of Black Twitter relies on a participatory mode of online expression which constitutes what Gleason calls an avenue for informal learning. Informal learning is characterized as “unplanned, spontaneous and outside of the school-based curriculum”, which has the potential of being “collaborative, participatory and often drive by interest“ (p.968). More concretely, on Twitter users can “join a conversation by tweeting and retweeting or broaden the conversation to include relevant experts and more knowledgeable others”. Taking the example of the Occupy Wall Street hashtag, the author argues that Twitter enables the inclusion of “many additional voices” (p.973) which translated into a strong prevalence of “user-generated content” in the OWS hashtag instead of “mainstream or corporate media” (p.972). This phenomenon creates an “information neighborhood” within which users contribute and share information related to the issue (p.974) which enables users to incorporate “different perspectives in multiple modalities, including text, video, audio and image” (p.978). Black Twitter and its hashtags present similar features and participation modes. 

## Mainstreaming an online social movement 

Mainstreaming a movement, a cause, and frames however entails exiting one’s niche by scaling sufficiently to capture a broader audience. Tufecki argues that in order to scale up movements need to grab users’ attention, since “attention is the means through which a social movement can introduce and fight for its preferred framing, convince broader publics of its cause, recruit new members, attempt to neutralize opposition framing, access solidarity, and mobilize its own adherents” (p.849). This notion of attention is especially important for social movements in a context of “abundant or even redundant online content”, in which “attention is the most valuable asset” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Grabbing attention usually depends on what Tufecki calls opinion-leaders, “politically motivated noninstitutional actors who use affordances of social media to engage in presentation of their political and personal selves to garner public attention to their cause, usually through a combination of testimony, advocacy, and citizen journalism.” (p.850) Xu, Sang, Blasiola and Park define these users with high connectivity and issue involvement as users that tend to be “better at influencing information flow on Twitter” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Accordingly, these users can influence the information flow both by “contributing information” and then by inciting others to “disseminate information”.
Some researchers are wary of such a heavy dependence on opinion leaders: Wilkins, Livingstone & Levine notably argue that these opinion leaders tend to come from privileged groups. These users are able to leverage their resources, power, and status to spread the message and frames to a broad audience. However, this poses the risk of “reproducing the subordination of disadvantaged groups within the movement” (p.788). Wilking & al are particularly wary of how this phenomenon may result in influencing, altering, and undermining radical frames brought by underprivileged activists, in a way that could contribute to “rarefying the issue of police brutality, downplaying its prevalence and importance in society” (p.794)
