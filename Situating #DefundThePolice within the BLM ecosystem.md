# #DefundThePolice, #AbolishThePolice, #ReformThePolice within the Black Lives Matter ecosystem 



Both #DefundThePolice and #AbolishThePolice appear among tweets most frequently associated with #BlackLivesMatter. Most specifically, #DefundThePolice is associated with hashtags related to victims of police violence: Jacob Blake, George Floyd, and seems to be structured around a bigger conversation around Police Brutality. 


As to #AbolishthePolice, the hashtag is mostly associated with geographic locations, especially Portland. Portland protests have drawn throughout the summer an intense mediatization due to the large scale of the demonstrations organised, and of rioting and looting that took place. More importantly, the Portland protests sparked a conversation around the harsh repression of these demonstrations by law enforcement, a situation that promptly escalated as the American government sent federal troops to control. This preliminary analysis of the hashtags seems to point to #AbolishThePolice and #DefundThePolice as two structuring frames within the Black Lives Matter movement, with #DefundThePolice being used as a more mainstream and general critique of the police and Abolish the Police being tied to more local and radical social mobilizations. This speaks to the extent of the social mobilization of local organizations and local demonstrations in Portland, the echo that they encountered across the country and the ongoing impact that these protests had in shaping the narrative: these demonstrations lasted 100 days.
