# Mainstreaming Radical Ideas Online: #DefundThePolice after George Floyd's Murder

Almost two years after the death of George Floyd and the wave of movements calling for more social justice, the idea of a profound reform of the repressive system in the United States has made its way. In 2021, for example, across the US, $840 million was taken away from police while $160 million was spent on life and community investments. Such statistics echo the waves of protests that marked spring and summer 2020, including the ‘Defund the police’ movement.

## Introduction

Defund the police is a slogan that means reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resources. While this idea is not new, it has had a particular resonance from the year 2020. The murder of African-American George Floyd by white police officer Derek Chauvin once again brought the institution of policing into disrepute, while at the same time the country was plunged into a pandemic crisis that highlighted the failure of several social services, foremost among them the health system. 

The idea of cutting police funding in favor of other services that could directly improve the lives of communities lean on several arguments. For example, abolitionists doubt the effectiveness of the police in ensuring public safety. They point to the high number of unsolved or unsolved cases of murder, rape and domestic violence. For example, in 2021, of the 15,000 murder cases recorded in the United States, one-third remained unsolved. Abolitionists also denounce a racist continuum in policing: the slave patrols, the enforcement of Jim Crow laws, and the repression of the civil rights movement, which would explain why police repression and the prison system primarily targeted minorities. Finally, abolitionists argue that the police are charged with the enforcement and supervision of too many public service missions for which officers are often unfit or ill-suited. For example, they consider it unrealistic for a police officer to be able to respond to problems of poor housing, mental illness or addiction that they must constantly confront in their current mission. They advocate instead for an unbundling of services so that many services that were previously provided by law enforcement would be provided by specialized response teams such as social workers, emergency medical technicians, conflict resolution specialists.

Calls for defunding the police have been growing the last two years and jumped out at many activists and ordinary citizens. However, such ideas are not new and have their roots in long-standing concepts and observations in the United States. ‘Defund the police’ is only the moderate part of a movement to abolish the police. The latter is itself a branch of the abolitionist movement as a whole, which originally aimed to abolish slavery and which, by extension, refers to all movements that seek to abolish an institution or a law, including the police, but also prisons and courts. In his 1935 book Black Reconstruction in America, the black American historian W.E.B Du Bois speaks of 'abolition-democracy', which advocates the suppression of institutions anchored in racist and repressive practices, including prisons, convict leasing and white police forces. In the context of President Lyndon B. Johnson Johnson's 'war on crime', which prioritized fighting crime through repression and prisons, activist Angela Davis exhumed these concepts from oblivion and argued for the funding or abolition of police departments. In the late 1990s, prisons and prison populations increased dramatically, particularly in California. There was a resurgence of the abolitionist movement to stop states from building more prisons, again led by long-time activists such as Ruth Wilson Gilmore and Angela Davis, with the formation of groups such as the California Prison Moratorium Project, which Gilmore helped found.
Thus, abolitionist movements on all sides, whether in relation to prisons or the police, have until recently been a minority and marginalized. They were mainly to be found in the discussions of academics or radical activists, away from mass public opinion which was generally unaware of their existence. Although the movement gained prominence in the 1960s and 1990s, this was not commensurate with the scale of the movement after May 2020 and the death of George Floyd. Signs with slogans such as ‘Defund the police’, ‘Invest in black community’, ‘Fund services, not police’ multiplied as the demonstrations went on. 
From internet outrage to street protests, social networks have played a crucial role in the spread and organization of these social movements. The video of George Floyd's arrest was the first to be posted on Facebook. The hashtags that flourished on Twitter also corresponded to the slogans brandished by the demonstrators. Between May, 27 and August, 31, in the U.S., more than 12,500 tweets containing #DefundThePolice have been published meanwhile there were none on May, 25 and 26. 
It is then necessary to question the process of diffusion of the hashtag that took place on Twitter during this period. In other words, by what mechanisms did a marginal movement become relatively mainstream on Twitter?

# Literature Review

### Black Twitter as a Digital Counterpublic 
Hashtags such as #BLM #SayHerName #ICan’tBreath and #OscarsSoWhite have notably been mobilized within what is colloquially referred to as Black Twitter. Black Twitter refers to “a collective of active, primarily African-American Twitter users who have created a virtual community ... [and are] proving adept at bringing about a wide range of sociopolitical changes”(Jones 2013). Black Twitter most specifically refers to the way in which users, most of whom are African-American interact on Twitter around issues mostly focused on race and popular culture. Black Twitter has been heralded over the past few years as the “new railroad underground” (Jones 2013) for African Americans, “a merciless watchdog for problematic behavior” (Wheeler 2019) for its mobilizing potential: this online space has enabled users to rally behind essential causes, bringing awareness to specific social issues, and call out problematic behaviors. 

Hill has argued that Black Twitter constitutes “a digital counterpublic” that he defines as a “digitally networked community in which members actively resist hegemonic power, contest majoritarian narratives, engage in critical dialogues, or negotiate oppositional identities”. According to him, ​​as a digital counterpublic, Black Twitter has “enabled critical pedagogy, political organizing, and both symbolic and material forms of resistance to anti-Black state violence within the United States” among predominantly African American users. Notably, with the raise of #BlackLivesMatter, Black Twitter has provided an online space that has enabled African Americans communities to bypass mainstream media outlets, “digitally capture everyday interactions with law enforcement” (Hill p.287), and collectively organize around police violence. Within this “digital counter-public” (p.290), BLM disseminated “non-dominant narratives” (Mundt 2018, p.10) “about police brutality and Black liberation” (Mundt 2018, p.1)  Social media and hashtags have been key in the dissemination process, by acting as “collective action frames” (Ray & Brown 2017, p.1799) which link together “events of police brutality” by “locating texts, videos and pictures within a specific conversation” (Bonilla & Rosa 2015, p.5). 

The pedagogical aspect of Black Twitter relies on a participatory mode of online expression which constitutes what Gleason calls an avenue for informal learning. Informal learning is characterized as “unplanned, spontaneous and outside of the school-based curriculum”, which has the potential of being “collaborative, participatory and often drive by interest“ (p.968). More concretely, on Twitter users can “join a conversation by tweeting and retweeting or broaden the conversation to include relevant experts and more knowledgeable others”. Taking the example of the Occupy Wall Street hashtag, the author argues that Twitter enables the inclusion of “many additional voices” (p.973) which translated into a strong prevalence of “user-generated content” in the OWS hashtag instead of “mainstream or corporate media” (p.972). This phenomenon creates an “information neighborhood” within which users contribute and share information related to the issue (p.974) which enables users to incorporate “different perspectives in multiple modalities, including text, video, audio and image” (p.978). Black Twitter and its hashtags present similar features and participation modes. 

## Mainstreaming an online social movement 

Mainstreaming a movement, a cause, and frames however entails exiting one’s niche by scaling sufficiently to capture a broader audience. Tufecki argues that in order to scale up movements need to grab users’ attention, since “attention is the means through which a social movement can introduce and fight for its preferred framing, convince broader publics of its cause, recruit new members, attempt to neutralize opposition framing, access solidarity, and mobilize its own adherents” (p.849). This notion of attention is especially important for social movements in a context of “abundant or even redundant online content”, in which “attention is the most valuable asset” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Grabbing attention usually depends on what Tufecki calls opinion-leaders, “politically motivated noninstitutional actors who use affordances of social media to engage in presentation of their political and personal selves to garner public attention to their cause, usually through a combination of testimony, advocacy, and citizen journalism.” (p.850) Xu, Sang, Blasiola and Park define these users with high connectivity and issue involvement as users that tend to be “better at influencing information flow on Twitter” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Accordingly, these users can influence the information flow both by “contributing information” and then by inciting others to “disseminate information”.
Some researchers are wary of such a heavy dependence on opinion leaders: Wilkins, Livingstone & Levine notably argue that these opinion leaders tend to come from privileged groups. These users are able to leverage their resources, power, and status to spread the message and frames to a broad audience. However, this poses the risk of “reproducing the subordination of disadvantaged groups within the movement” (p.788). Wilking & al are particularly wary of how this phenomenon may result in influencing, altering, and undermining radical frames brought by underprivileged activists, in a way that could contribute to “rarefying the issue of police brutality, downplaying its prevalence and importance in society” (p.794)

# Methodology 
In order to conduct this analysis on the mainstreaming of police abolition in 2020, we have mainly relied on collecting and analyzing tweets. We looked at trending hashtags that were used to push for specific framing of police violence within the Black Lives Matter movement. 

**Black Lives Matter** :  A decentralized political and social movement that seeks to highlight racism, discrimination, and inequality experienced by black people. 

**Defund The Police**: Advocates reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resource

**Abolish The Police** : Avocates replacing policing with other systems of public safety. Police abolitionists believe that policing, as a system, is inherently flawed and cannot be reformed as it is deeply rooted in a history of white supremacy and settler colonialism

**Reform The Police**: Without questioning the existence of the police, the movement advocates the reorganisation of hierarchical structures, staffing, and the training of police in alternative approaches to law enforcement.

## Sources
We have focused on the summer of 2020, following George Floyd’s murder (May 25th to August 31st) and collected tweets with the Twitter Explorer and the Twitter API associated with the following queries to constitute a corpus of tweets: 
#DefundThePolice
#BlackLivesMatter
#ReformThePolice
#AbolishThePolice
We notably used the Twitter Explorer in order to collect and visualize our data. 
 
We have then conducted both quantitative and qualitative analysis on this corpus of tweets, and some degree of network analysis. We were predominantly interested in studying the frames brought by these tweets, their engagement rate, and how these hashtags have performed comparatively.  


## Quantitative analysis
We analyzed Twitter metadata, notably retweet counts, the volume of tweets, co-occurrences of hashtags  and we designed networks to account for interactions between accounts. We also leveraged topic modelling and tf-idf in order to highlight key terms. 

## Qualitative analysis 
We performed critical discourse analysis on the tweets that have received the most engagement from all of our corpus, in order to understand which frames worked best. 


# #DefundThePolice within the Black Lives Matter Ecosystem

## Black Lives Matter after George Floyd: Quantitative Features

The volume of Tweets with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was particularly high from the end of May, and throughout most of June. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161732952-1c4b55b5-5d08-4f04-84a5-f4c8f752eec2.png)
If we zoom in on the first couple of weeks, we can see that it peaked on June 2nd. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161733387-ac9bbed3-5173-4343-be79-b99dacd4c252.png)

We computed engagement with tweets by looking at retweets, and we saw that the evolution of retweets throughout the summer mirrored that of total tweets:

## Black Lives Matter after George Floyd: Qualitative Features

We carried out a topic modelling analysis with the entire corpus and we found the following: 
```
topic 0: black   woman   community   mourn   brown   fight   business   sister   folk   brother
topic 1: police   brutality   officer   violence   protester   department   force   reform   city   murder

We have attributed labels to these topics in particular the following: 
- Community, and the role of Black women within this community
- Police Brutality and the need for change 
- The history of systemic racism 
- The importance of community
- Topic 4 was more uncertain, and we thought that it related to physical occurences of the #BLM movement, notably with the BLM Mural, and the protests organized on the plaza. 
- Protests and clashes with the police 
- White supremacy in America

We then performed a topic modelling analysis of #BlackLivesMatter

```
topic 0: black   woman   community   mourn   fight   brown   business   sister   brother   folk
topic 1: protest   peaceful   protester   city   downtown   protestor   tonight   street   safe   riot

topic 14: man   woman   young   year   officer   video   old   unarmed   innocent   child
```
These topics are very similar to that of the entire corpus, which can be explained by Black Lives Matter having significantly more tweets than the other hashtags that we have studied.
- Community, and the role of Black women within this community
- Protests and clashes with the police
- The history of systemic racism 
- Violence during protests as an argument in favor of reform
- The importance of community

We then performed a topic modelling analysis of #DefundThePolice 

```
topic 0: police   defund   department   brutality   reform   violence   union   force   immunity   state
topic 1: people   white   power   change   harming   t   real   problem   murder   american

topic 14: video   new   body   camera   protester   cam   evidence   footage   watch   t
```
We attributed the following labels to the first topics highlighted: 
- Police brutality and the need for change 
- Race relations and systemic racism 
- Police violence and criticism of the police 
- The need for resources to be allocated to social services
- Systemic racism 
- Topic 5 was not very clear to us 
- The need to change budget to refund the police effectively 
- Topic 7 was unclear to us
- Protests and clashes against the police

We observe a great deal of convergence between #DefundThePolice and the main corpus, in particular as it relates with violent protests, and the need to change profoundly change the police institution. We hypothesize that the #DefundThePolice contributed to shaping these frames within the broader Black lives Matter movement. In order to demonstrae this, we look at a hashtag network around #BlackLivesMatter, in order to see whether there were any co-occurences of #BLM and #DefundThePolice 

## Hashtag Network

This is the hashtag network that we generated thanks to the Twitter Explorer, which shows hastags most associated with #BLM. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161737084-dc18d710-3e0a-4405-92f8-af1a1b54ac8c.png)
We can see that within our query, #DefundThePolice and #AbolishThePolice are among tweets most frequently associated with #BlackLivesMatter.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161737117-17e36aca-920d-4d9f-82ed-a90f560b552c.png)

If we zoom in:

#DefundThePolice is associated with hashtags related to victims of police violence: Jacob Blake, George Floyd, and seems to be structured around a bigger conversation around Police Brutality.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161737371-4d886f8a-3c9f-4216-9a02-8103686d3fe0.png)

As to #AbolishthePolice, the hashtag is mostly associated with geographic locations, especially Portland. Portland protests have drawn throughout the summer an intense mediatization due to the large scale of the demonstrations organised, and of rioting and looting that took place. More importantly, the Portland protests sparked a conversation around the harsh repression of these demonstrations by law enforcement, a situation that promptly escalated as the American government sent federal troops to control. 
This preliminary analysis of the hashtags seems to point to #AbolishThePolice and #DefundThePolice as two structuring frames within the Black Lives Matter movement, with #DefundThePolice being used as a more mainstream and general critique of the police and Abolish the Police being tied to more local and radical social mobilizations. This speaks to the extent of the social mobilization of local organizations and local demonstrations in Portland, the echo that they encountered across the country and the ongoing impact that these protests had in shaping the narrative: these demonstrations lasted 100 days.
