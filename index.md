# Mainstreaming Radical Ideas Online: #DefundThePolice after George Floyd's Murder

Almost two years after the death of George Floyd and the wave of movements calling for more social justice, the idea of a profound reform of the repressive system in the United States has made its way. In 2021, for example, across the US, $840 million was taken away from police while $160 million was spent on life and community investments. Such statistics echo the waves of protests that marked spring and summer 2020, including the ‘Defund the police’ movement.

## Introduction

Defund the police is a slogan that means reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resources. While this idea is not new, it has had a particular resonance from the year 2020. The murder of African-American George Floyd by white police officer Derek Chauvin once again brought the institution of policing into disrepute, while at the same time the country was plunged into a pandemic crisis that highlighted the failure of several social services, foremost among them the health system. 

The idea of cutting police funding in favor of other services that could directly improve the lives of communities lean on several arguments. For example, abolitionists doubt the effectiveness of the police in ensuring public safety. They point to the high number of unsolved or unsolved cases of murder, rape and domestic violence. For example, in 2021, of the 15,000 murder cases recorded in the United States, one-third remained unsolved. Abolitionists also denounce a racist continuum in policing: the slave patrols, the enforcement of Jim Crow laws, and the repression of the civil rights movement, which would explain why police repression and the prison system primarily targeted minorities. Finally, abolitionists argue that the police are charged with the enforcement and supervision of too many public service missions for which officers are often unfit or ill-suited. For example, they consider it unrealistic for a police officer to be able to respond to problems of poor housing, mental illness or addiction that they must constantly confront in their current mission. They advocate instead for an unbundling of services so that many services that were previously provided by law enforcement would be provided by specialized response teams such as social workers, emergency medical technicians, conflict resolution specialists.

Calls for defunding the police have been growing the last two years and jumped out at many activists and ordinary citizens. However, such ideas are not new and have their roots in long-standing concepts and observations in the United States. ‘Defund the police’ is only the moderate part of a movement to abolish the police. The latter is itself a branch of the abolitionist movement as a whole, which originally aimed to abolish slavery and which, by extension, refers to all movements that seek to abolish an institution or a law, including the police, but also prisons and courts. In his 1935 book Black Reconstruction in America, the black American historian W.E.B Du Bois speaks of 'abolition-democracy', which advocates the suppression of institutions anchored in racist and repressive practices, including prisons, convict leasing and white police forces. In the context of President Lyndon B. Johnson Johnson's 'war on crime', which prioritized fighting crime through repression and prisons, activist Angela Davis exhumed these concepts from oblivion and argued for the funding or abolition of police departments. In the late 1990s, prisons and prison populations increased dramatically, particularly in California. There was a resurgence of the abolitionist movement to stop states from building more prisons, again led by long-time activists such as Ruth Wilson Gilmore and Angela Davis, with the formation of groups such as the California Prison Moratorium Project, which Gilmore helped found.
Thus, abolitionist movements on all sides, whether in relation to prisons or the police, have until recently been a minority and marginalized. They were mainly to be found in the discussions of academics or radical activists, away from mass public opinion which was generally unaware of their existence. Although the movement gained prominence in the 1960s and 1990s, this was not commensurate with the scale of the movement after May 2020 and the death of George Floyd. Signs with slogans such as ‘Defund the police’, ‘Invest in black community’, ‘Fund services, not police’ multiplied as the demonstrations went on. 
From internet outrage to street protests, social networks have played a crucial role in the spread and organization of these social movements. The video of George Floyd's arrest was the first to be posted on Facebook. The hashtags that flourished on Twitter also corresponded to the slogans brandished by the demonstrators. Between May, 27 and August, 31, in the U.S., more than 12,500 tweets containing #DefundThePolice have been published meanwhile there were none on May, 25 and 26. 
It is then necessary to question the process of diffusion of the hashtag that took place on Twitter during this period. In other words, by what mechanisms did a marginal movement become relatively mainstream on Twitter?

## Literature review

Hashtags such as #BLM #SayHerName #ICan’tBreath and #OscarsSoWhite have notably been mobilized within what is colloquially referred to as Black Twitter. Black Twitter refers to “a collective of active, primarily African-American Twitter users who have created a virtual community ... [and are] proving adept at bringing about a wide range of sociopolitical changes”(Jones 2013). Black Twitter most specifically refers to the way in which users, most of whom are African-American interact on Twitter around issues mostly focused on race and popular culture. Black Twitter has been heralded over the past few years as the “new railroad underground” (Jones 2013) for African Americans, “a merciless watchdog for problematic behavior” (Wheeler 2019) for its mobilizing potential: this online space has enabled users to rally behind essential causes, bringing awareness to specific social issues, and call out problematic behaviors. 

Hill has argued that Black Twitter constitutes “a digital counterpublic” that he defines as a “digitally networked community in which members actively resist hegemonic power, contest majoritarian narratives, engage in critical dialogues, or negotiate oppositional identities”. According to him, ​​as a digital counterpublic, Black Twitter has “enabled critical pedagogy, political organizing, and both symbolic and material forms of resistance to anti-Black state violence within the United States” among predominantly African American users. Notably, with the raise of #BlackLivesMatter, Black Twitter has provided an online space that has enabled African Americans communities to bypass mainstream media outlets, “digitally capture everyday interactions with law enforcement” (Hill p.287), and collectively organize around police violence. Within this “digital counter-public” (p.290), BLM disseminated “non-dominant narratives” (Mundt 2018, p.10) “about police brutality and Black liberation” (Mundt 2018, p.1)  Social media and hashtags have been key in the dissemination process, by acting as “collective action frames” (Ray & Brown 2017, p.1799) which link together “events of police brutality” by “locating texts, videos and pictures within a specific conversation” (Bonilla & Rosa 2015, p.5). 

The pedagogical aspect of Black Twitter relies on a participatory mode of online expression which constitutes what Gleason calls an avenue for informal learning. Informal learning is characterized as “unplanned, spontaneous and outside of the school-based curriculum”, which has the potential of being “collaborative, participatory and often drive by interest“ (p.968). More concretely, on Twitter users can “join a conversation by tweeting and retweeting or broaden the conversation to include relevant experts and more knowledgeable others”. Taking the example of the Occupy Wall Street hashtag, the author argues that Twitter enables the inclusion of “many additional voices” (p.973) which translated into a strong prevalence of “user-generated content” in the OWS hashtag instead of “mainstream or corporate media” (p.972). This phenomenon creates an “information neighborhood” within which users contribute and share information related to the issue (p.974) which enables users to incorporate “different perspectives in multiple modalities, including text, video, audio and image” (p.978). Black Twitter and its hashtags present similar features and participation modes. 

Mainstreaming a movement, a cause, and frames however entails exiting one’s niche by scaling sufficiently to capture a broader audience. Tufecki argues that in order to scale up movements need to grab users’ attention, since “attention is the means through which a social movement can introduce and fight for its preferred framing, convince broader publics of its cause, recruit new members, attempt to neutralize opposition framing, access solidarity, and mobilize its own adherents” (p.849). This notion of attention is especially important for social movements in a context of “abundant or even redundant online content”, in which “attention is the most valuable asset” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Grabbing attention usually depends on what Tufecki calls opinion-leaders, “politically motivated noninstitutional actors who use affordances of social media to engage in presentation of their political and personal selves to garner public attention to their cause, usually through a combination of testimony, advocacy, and citizen journalism.” (p.850) Xu, Sang, Blasiola and Park define these users with high connectivity and issue involvement as users that tend to be “better at influencing information flow on Twitter” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Accordingly, these users can influence the information flow both by “contributing information” and then by inciting others to “disseminate information”.

Some researchers are wary of such a heavy dependence on opinion leaders: Wilkins, Livingstone & Levine notably argue that these opinion leaders tend to come from privileged groups. These users are able to leverage their resources, power, and status to spread the message and frames to a broad audience. However, this poses the risk of “reproducing the subordination of disadvantaged groups within the movement” (p.788). Wilking & al are particularly wary of how this phenomenon may result in influencing, altering, and undermining radical frames brought by underprivileged activists, in a way that could contribute to “rarefying the issue of police brutality, downplaying its prevalence and importance in society” (p.794)

## Methodology

In order to conduct this analysis on the mainstreaming of police abolition in 2020, we have mainly relied on collecting and analyzing tweets. We have focused on the summer of 2020, following George Floyd’s murder and collected tweets with the Twitter Explorer associated with the following queries: #BlackLivesMatter, #DefundThePolice, #AbolishThePolice, #ReformThePolice, #8toAbolition and #8Can’tWait, which adds up to xtweets. We have then conducted both quantitative and qualitative analysis on this corpus of tweets, and some degree of network analysis. We were predominantly interested in studying the frames brought by these tweets, their engagement rate, and how these hashtags have performed comparatively.  We were also particularly interested in seeing how accounts performed based on their follower base and how communities' hashtags and accounts interacted with one another, and whether these interactions have changed over time. 

### Sources
We based our analysis on tweets published between May and August in the US, in English collected through the Twitter API. We used multiple queries to constitute a corpus: 
#DefundThePolice
#BlackLivesMatter
#ReformThePolice
#AbolishThePolice
We notably used the Twitter Explorer in order to collect and visualize our data. 

### Quantitative analysis
We analyzed Twitter metadata, notably retweet counts, the volume of tweets, co-occurrences of hashtags  and we designed networks to account for interactions between accounts. We also leveraged topic modelling and tf-idf in order to highlight key terms. 

### Qualitative analysis 
We performed critical discourse analysis on the tweets that have received the most engagement from all of our corpus, in order to understand which frames worked best.

### Main themes in our Twitter Corpus 


We instantiate the corpus object
```
lang = 'en_core_web_sm'
corpus = textacy.Corpus(lang)
for item in ['parser']:
  if item in corpus.spacy_lang.pipe_names:
      corpus.spacy_lang.remove_pipe(item)
```      
We add the documents 
```
corpus.add_texts(documents)
docs_terms = (textacy.extract.terms(doc,ngs=partial(textacy.extract.ngrams, n=1, include_pos={"NOUN", "ADJ"}),ents=partial(textacy.extract.entities, include_types={ "ORG", "GPE", "LOC"}))for doc in corpus)
tokenized_docs = (textacy.extract.terms_to_strings(doc_terms, by="lemma") for doc_terms in docs_terms)
doc_term_matrix, vocab = textacy.representations.build_doc_term_matrix(tokenized_docs,tf_type="linear", idf_type="smooth")
id_to_term = {id_: term for term, id_ in vocab.items()}
```
We carry out topic modelling with every single tweet 
```
import textacy.tm
model = textacy.tm.TopicModel("nmf", n_topics=15)
model.fit(doc_term_matrix)
doc_topic_matrix = model.transform(doc_term_matrix)
for topic_idx, terms in model.top_topic_terms(id_to_term, top_n=10):
    print(f"topic {topic_idx}: {'   '.join(terms)}")
```
We visualize the topic modelling matrix: 
```
 _ = model.termite_plot(doc_term_matrix, id_to_term, n_terms=50, highlight_topics=[0,4,6,2])
 ```
