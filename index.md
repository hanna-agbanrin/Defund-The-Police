# Mainstreaming Radical Ideas Online: #DefundThePolice after George Floyd's Murder

Almost two years after the death of George Floyd and the wave of movements calling for more social justice, the idea of a profound reform of the repressive system in the United States has made its way. In 2021, for example, across the US, $840 million was taken away from police while $160 million was spent on life and community investments. Such statistics echo the waves of protests that marked spring and summer 2020, including the ‘Defund the police’ movement.

## Introduction

Defund the police is a slogan that means reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resources. While this idea is not new, it has had a particular resonance from the year 2020. The murder of African-American George Floyd by white police officer Derek Chauvin once again brought the institution of policing into disrepute, while at the same time the country was plunged into a pandemic crisis that highlighted the failure of several social services, foremost among them the health system. The idea gained in pre-eminence throughout the summer of 2020, and was notably pushed for by the Black Lives Matter movement's founders, and the broader organization Movement for Black Lives. They called on people to petition to divest from the police and invest in communities, during their week of action, notably on June 2nd 2020.

The idea of cutting police funding in favor of other services that could directly improve the lives of communities lean on several arguments. For example, abolitionists doubt the effectiveness of the police in ensuring public safety. They point to the high number of unsolved or unsolved cases of murder, rape and domestic violence. For example, in 2021, of the 15,000 murder cases recorded in the United States, one-third remained unsolved. Abolitionists also denounce a racist continuum in policing: the slave patrols, the enforcement of Jim Crow laws, and the repression of the civil rights movement, which would explain why police repression and the prison system primarily targeted minorities. Finally, abolitionists argue that the police are charged with the enforcement and supervision of too many public service missions for which officers are often unfit or ill-suited. For example, they consider it unrealistic for a police officer to be able to respond to problems of poor housing, mental illness or addiction that they must constantly confront in their current mission. They advocate instead for an unbundling of services so that many services that were previously provided by law enforcement would be provided by specialized response teams such as social workers, emergency medical technicians, conflict resolution specialists.

Calls for defunding the police have been growing the last two years and jumped out at many activists and ordinary citizens. However, such ideas are not new and have their roots in long-standing concepts and observations in the United States. ‘Defund the police’ is only the moderate part of a movement to abolish the police. The latter is itself a branch of the abolitionist movement as a whole, which originally aimed to abolish slavery and which, by extension, refers to all movements that seek to abolish an institution or a law, including the police, but also prisons and courts. In his 1935 book Black Reconstruction in America, the black American historian W.E.B Du Bois speaks of 'abolition-democracy', which advocates the suppression of institutions anchored in racist and repressive practices, including prisons, convict leasing and white police forces. In the context of President Lyndon B. Johnson Johnson's 'war on crime', which prioritized fighting crime through repression and prisons, activist Angela Davis exhumed these concepts from oblivion and argued for the funding or abolition of police departments. In the late 1990s, prisons and prison populations increased dramatically, particularly in California. There was a resurgence of the abolitionist movement to stop states from building more prisons, again led by long-time activists such as Ruth Wilson Gilmore and Angela Davis, with the formation of groups such as the California Prison Moratorium Project, which Gilmore helped found.

Thus, abolitionist movements on all sides, whether in relation to prisons or the police, have until recently been a minority and marginalized. They were mainly to be found in the discussions of academics or radical activists, away from mass public opinion which was generally unaware of their existence. Although the movement gained prominence in the 1960s and 1990s, this was not commensurate with the scale of the movement after May 2020 and the death of George Floyd. Signs with slogans such as ‘Defund the police’, ‘Invest in black community’, ‘Fund services, not police’ multiplied as the demonstrations went on. 

From internet outrage to street protests, social networks have played a crucial role in the spread and organization of these social movements. The video of George Floyd's arrest was the first to be posted on Facebook. The hashtags that flourished on Twitter also corresponded to the slogans brandished by the demonstrators. Between May, 27 and August, 31, in the U.S., more than 12,500 tweets containing #DefundThePolice have been published meanwhile there were none on May, 25 and 26. 

It is then necessary to question the process of diffusion of the hashtag that took place on Twitter during this period. In other words, by what mechanisms did a marginal movement become relatively mainstream on Twitter?

# Literature Review

### Black Twitter as a Digital Counterpublic 
Hashtags such as #BLM #SayHerName #ICan’tBreath and #OscarsSoWhite have notably been mobilized within what is colloquially referred to as Black Twitter. Black Twitter refers to “a collective of active, primarily African-American Twitter users who have created a virtual community ... [and are] proving adept at bringing about a wide range of sociopolitical changes”(Jones 2013). Black Twitter most specifically refers to the way in which users, most of whom are African-American interact on Twitter around issues mostly focused on race and popular culture. Black Twitter has been heralded over the past few years as the “new railroad underground” (Jones 2013) for African Americans, “a merciless watchdog for problematic behavior” (Wheeler 2019) for its mobilizing potential: this online space has enabled users to rally behind essential causes, bringing awareness to specific social issues, and call out problematic behaviors. 

Hill has argued that Black Twitter constitutes “a digital counterpublic” that he defines as a “digitally networked community in which members actively resist hegemonic power, contest majoritarian narratives, engage in critical dialogues, or negotiate oppositional identities”. According to him, ​​as a digital counterpublic, Black Twitter has “enabled critical pedagogy, political organizing, and both symbolic and material forms of resistance to anti-Black state violence within the United States” among predominantly African American users. Notably, with the raise of #BlackLivesMatter, Black Twitter has provided an online space that has enabled African Americans communities to bypass mainstream media outlets, “digitally capture everyday interactions with law enforcement” (Hill p.287), and collectively organize around police violence. Within this “digital counter-public” (p.290), BLM disseminated “non-dominant narratives” (Mundt 2018, p.10) “about police brutality and Black liberation” (Mundt 2018, p.1)  Social media and hashtags have been key in the dissemination process, by acting as “collective action frames” (Ray & Brown 2017, p.1799) which link together “events of police brutality” by “locating texts, videos and pictures within a specific conversation” (Bonilla & Rosa 2015, p.5). 

The pedagogical aspect of Black Twitter relies on a participatory mode of online expression which constitutes what Gleason calls an avenue for informal learning. Informal learning is characterized as “unplanned, spontaneous and outside of the school-based curriculum”, which has the potential of being “collaborative, participatory and often drive by interest“ (p.968). More concretely, on Twitter users can “join a conversation by tweeting and retweeting or broaden the conversation to include relevant experts and more knowledgeable others”. Taking the example of the Occupy Wall Street hashtag, the author argues that Twitter enables the inclusion of “many additional voices” (p.973) which translated into a strong prevalence of “user-generated content” in the OWS hashtag instead of “mainstream or corporate media” (p.972). This phenomenon creates an “information neighborhood” within which users contribute and share information related to the issue (p.974) which enables users to incorporate “different perspectives in multiple modalities, including text, video, audio and image” (p.978). Black Twitter and its hashtags present similar features and participation modes. 

## Mainstreaming an online social movement 

Mainstreaming a movement, a cause, and frames however entails exiting one’s niche by scaling sufficiently to capture a broader audience. Tufecki argues that in order to scale up movements need to grab users’ attention, since “attention is the means through which a social movement can introduce and fight for its preferred framing, convince broader publics of its cause, recruit new members, attempt to neutralize opposition framing, access solidarity, and mobilize its own adherents” (p.849). This notion of attention is especially important for social movements in a context of “abundant or even redundant online content”, in which “attention is the most valuable asset” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Grabbing attention usually depends on what Tufecki calls opinion-leaders, “politically motivated noninstitutional actors who use affordances of social media to engage in presentation of their political and personal selves to garner public attention to their cause, usually through a combination of testimony, advocacy, and citizen journalism.” (p.850) Xu, Sang, Blasiola and Park define these users with high connectivity and issue involvement as users that tend to be “better at influencing information flow on Twitter” (Xu, Sang, Blasiola, Park 2014 p.1279). Accordingly, these users can influence the information flow both by “contributing information” and then by inciting others to “disseminate information”.

Some researchers are wary of such a heavy dependence on opinion leaders: Wilkins, Livingstone & Levine notably argue that these opinion leaders tend to come from privileged groups. These users are able to leverage their resources, power, and status to spread the message and frames to a broad audience. However, this poses the risk of “reproducing the subordination of disadvantaged groups within the movement” (p.788). Wilking & al are particularly wary of how this phenomenon may result in influencing, altering, and undermining radical frames brought by underprivileged activists, in a way that could contribute to “rarefying the issue of police brutality, downplaying its prevalence and importance in society” (p.794)

# Methodology 

We are interested in understanding how #DefundThePolice managed to mainstream its frames on the issue of police brutality? In order to do so, we want to analyse  #DefundThePolice's place within the Black Lives Matter ecosystem, and understand how it contributed to shape frames around the issue of police brutality. We also look at the temporality of these frames, in conjunction with engagement on social media to see which frames have garnered the most engagement. Finally we analyse the interplay between key actors in order to understand who precisely contributed to shape the narrative and mainstream it. 

In order to conduct this analysis on the mainstreaming of police abolition in 2020, we have mainly relied on collecting and analyzing tweets. We looked at trending hashtags that were used to push for specific framing of police violence within the Black Lives Matter movement. 

**Black Lives Matter** :  A decentralized political and social movement that seeks to highlight racism, discrimination, and inequality experienced by black people. 

**Defund The Police**: Advocates reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resource

**Abolish The Police** : Avocates replacing policing with other systems of public safety. Police abolitionists believe that policing, as a system, is inherently flawed and cannot be reformed as it is deeply rooted in a history of white supremacy and settler colonialism

**Reform The Police**: Without questioning the existence of the police, the movement advocates the reorganisation of hierarchical structures, staffing, and the training of police in alternative approaches to law enforcement.

## Sources

We have focused on the summer of 2020, following George Floyd’s murder (May 25th to August 31st) and collected tweets with the Twitter Explorer and the Twitter API associated with the following queries to constitute a corpus of tweets: 
#DefundThePolice
#BlackLivesMatter
#ReformThePolice
#AbolishThePolice
We notably used the Twitter Explorer in order to collect and visualize our data. 
 
We have then conducted both quantitative and qualitative analysis on this corpus of tweets, and some degree of network analysis. We were predominantly interested in studying the frames brought by these tweets, their engagement rate, and how these hashtags have performed comparatively.  


## Quantitative analysis
We analyzed Twitter metadata, notably retweet counts, the volume of tweets, co-occurrences of hashtags  and we designed networks to account for interactions between accounts. We also leveraged topic modelling and tf-idf in order to highlight key terms. 

## Qualitative analysis 
We performed critical discourse analysis on the tweets that have received the most engagement from all of our corpus, in order to understand which frames worked best. 


# #DefundThePolice within the Black Lives Matter Ecosystem

## Black Lives Matter after George Floyd: Quantitative Features

The volume of Tweets with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was particularly high from the end of May, and throughout most of June. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161732952-1c4b55b5-5d08-4f04-84a5-f4c8f752eec2.png)
If we zoom in on the first couple of weeks, we can see that it peaked on June 2nd. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161733387-ac9bbed3-5173-4343-be79-b99dacd4c252.png)

We computed engagement with tweets by looking at retweets, and we saw that the evolution of retweets throughout the summer mirrored that of total tweets:

## Black Lives Matter after George Floyd: Qualitative Features

We carried out a topic modelling analysis with the entire corpus and we found the following: 
```

We have attributed labels to these topics in particular the following: 
- Community, and the role of Black women within this community
- Police Brutality and the need for change 
- The history of systemic racism 
- The importance of community
- Topic 4 was more uncertain, and we thought that it related to physical occurences of the #BLM movement, notably with the BLM Mural, and the protests organized on the plaza. 
- Protests and clashes with the police 
- White supremacy in America

We then performed a topic modelling analysis of #BlackLivesMatter

```
topic 0: black   woman   community   mourn   fight   brown   business   sister   brother   folk
topic 1: protest   peaceful   protester   city   downtown   protestor   tonight   street   safe   riot

topic 14: man   woman   young   year   officer   video   old   unarmed   innocent   child
```
These topics are very similar to that of the entire corpus, which can be explained by Black Lives Matter having significantly more tweets than the other hashtags that we have studied.
- Community, and the role of Black women within this community
- Protests and clashes with the police
- The history of systemic racism 
- Violence during protests as an argument in favor of reform
- The importance of community

We then performed a topic modelling analysis of #DefundThePolice 

```
topic 0: police   defund   department   brutality   reform   violence   union   force   immunity   state
topic 1: people   white   power   change   harming   t   real   problem   murder   american

topic 14: video   new   body   camera   protester   cam   evidence   footage   watch   t
```
We attributed the following labels to the first topics highlighted: 
- Police brutality and the need for change 
- Race relations and systemic racism 
- Police violence and criticism of the police 
- The need for resources to be allocated to social services
- Systemic racism 
- Topic 5 was not very clear to us 
- The need to change budget to refund the police effectively 
- Topic 7 was unclear to us
- Protests and clashes against the police

We observe a great deal of convergence between #DefundThePolice and the main corpus, in particular as it relates with violent protests, and the need to change profoundly change the police institution. We hypothesize that the #DefundThePolice contributed to shaping these frames within the broader Black lives Matter movement. In order to demonstrae this, we look at a hashtag network around #BlackLivesMatter, in order to see whether there were any co-occurences of #BLM and #DefundThePolice 

## Hashtag Network

This is the hashtag network that we generated thanks to the Twitter Explorer, which shows hastags most associated with #BLM. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161737084-dc18d710-3e0a-4405-92f8-af1a1b54ac8c.png)

We can see that within our query, #DefundThePolice and #AbolishThePolice are among tweets most frequently associated with #BlackLivesMatter.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161737117-17e36aca-920d-4d9f-82ed-a90f560b552c.png)

If we zoom in: 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161737337-5f11cf9b-4050-4af7-a2a5-004ff3fc67b3.png)

#DefundThePolice is associated with hashtags related to victims of police violence: Jacob Blake, George Floyd, and seems to be structured around a bigger conversation around Police Brutality.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161737371-4d886f8a-3c9f-4216-9a02-8103686d3fe0.png)

As to #AbolishthePolice, the hashtag is mostly associated with geographic locations, especially Portland. Portland protests have drawn throughout the summer an intense mediatization due to the large scale of the demonstrations organised, and of rioting and looting that took place. More importantly, the Portland protests sparked a conversation around the harsh repression of these demonstrations by law enforcement, a situation that promptly escalated as the American government sent federal troops to control. 
This preliminary analysis of the hashtags seems to point to #AbolishThePolice and #DefundThePolice as two structuring frames within the Black Lives Matter movement, with #DefundThePolice being used as a more mainstream and general critique of the police and Abolish the Police being tied to more local and radical social mobilizations. This speaks to the extent of the social mobilization of local organizations and local demonstrations in Portland, the echo that they encountered across the country and the ongoing impact that these protests had in shaping the narrative: these demonstrations lasted 100 days.


# Dominant Frames 

In the previous parts, we focused on the popular hashtags within the BLM ecosystem, compared them and analyzed the narratives they brought, which was part of our general“frame analysis” process. Frame analysis is a social science research method that focuses on how a topic is represented through the specific issues and sub-topics that people focus on, and how actors may exert an influence on this selection process. Framing mechanisms are a key mobilization process when it comes to social movements. Indeed, they “assign meaning to and interpret relevant events and conditions in ways that are intended to mobilize potential adherents and constituents, to garner bystander support, and to demobilize antagonists” (Snow & Benford, 1988). It is a conscious and unconscious process.  Collective action frames involve “negotiating shared meaning” (Gamson, 1992) which allow movements to ‘legitimize their actions, create a sense of collective identity and inspire support, characterize messages in ways that resonate with the public’ (Wenlin Liu, Summer Harlow, 2020). Social media is a strong diffusion mechanism for spreading those social movement frames and strategies, allowing both a relational and a mediated model of diffusion; platforms such as twitter facilitate frame alignment, which Snow and Benford define as the alignment of individual frames in congruence and complementariness. This frame alignment produces frame resonance, which in turn helps a group transition from one frame to another. 

We chose to focus on the peaks of engagement for the popular #BLM and #Defundthepolice hashtags (volume of tweets) in order to identify the main frame alignments on Twitter during these time periods during which the movement was the most visible. What topics generated the most engagement? Was there any discrepancy between the frames of the most popular tweets, and the frames that were the most discussed? Did the movement transition from one dominant frame to another during or between peaks? For #defund the police, the time periods we identified were the first three weeks of our corpus (2020.05.28, 2020.06.06, 2020.06.15); #blacklives matter had several bigger peaks at the same time (same weeks, with a massive peak of engagement on 2020.06.02) and a smaller peak between 2020.08.24 and 2020.08.27.

In order to simplify the analysis, we adopted the three kinds of frames conceptualized by Snow and Benford: first, diagnostic framing, which states the problem (generally in Manichean terms), identifies victims, assigns blame (“X killed Y”, “X is racist”). Secondly, prognostic framing, which offers solutions and how they could be implemented (“A should do B”). Finally, motivational framing is more of a call to arms that legitimizes the movement (principles) and spreads action-oriented leitmotivs related to what people should do if they agree with the diagnostic frame and the prognostic frame (for example, “vote A”, “contact B”…)

First, using the open source, web-based application Voyant Tools made for text mining, we decided to identify the main topics of the top 20 tweets during the first week, for the BLM hashtag.

![4keHyCTYQ3xNlDYZ1YQGwAeO32tm30nmOvzizrMAB7c_d4BGjfHLGWB_vI_Hlo53uOhGBKZ6yEtgMB74XYEQVpv3bsSDaHJA1woLQfJtbjIO3rAZoL3X4EilcVCPy7LOkCVj2pc-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/162073279-e761790a-986f-4759-86ee-03d9ebcd77d3.png)

Then, we created a simplified network visualization of the most frequent word associations of the top 20 tweets of week 1 (BLM). As expected, they were related to diagnostic framing; explaining the circumstances of George Floyd’s death and the crux of the problem for the BLM movement: “racism”, “white privilege”, a call for “justice” and “ending violence”. (*Side note, the “batman” wildcard is related to a man that came to a protest dressed up as Batman and generated a lot of RTs, but we also noticed people using it both to say things along the lines of “we need batman” and as a derogatory way to call policemen “racist vigilantes”). 

![qdE6_aq6T1_kOqvsp-T9zjQ4oYK59QCXpP5BQpWlEqlMn5pZRvHwAMp3QSmGSDRKLnZQwYKPyQ6HOwczqoVOn6iVW0kkMvQEDOn16RDdrYhwu6DEDUUEw1tzKwJgFo1tBuHWNSh4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/162073426-65658af1-b2cd-45c6-8afc-f1ab27d6fd5e.png)

Meanwhile, the analysis of the top 20 most popular #defundthepolice hashtags during Week 1 produced more prognostic oriented results and had more precise targets when it came to diagnosing the situation and assigning blame (denouncing how education had been defunded but not the police, pointing out specific departments/city councils/mayors) and was also more directly linked to the protests (“protesters”, “tear gas”, “transit/traffic” issues, “medics”).

Using TF-IDF we drew out the most frequent words of the most popular tweets during each peak, and the most frequent words in general during in peak, and ran a comparative analysis. 

The data:

### Rough Generalization 

Rough generalization:
Main topics (popular tweets): George Floyd, tear gas on protesters/medic shot, defunding the police = not so radical, confederate monument, Jacob Blake shot in front of his children
Main topics (volume): [W1] black/white&police (privilege, violence), justice. [W2] more immediate topics (today, protest, curfew), more urgent calls for justice (need/now/no time). [W3]: budget & defund are more frequently used as well as, “support”, community; less frequent use of “white”, the tweets are more oriented on the black community and the need for support & actual reforms. [W14]: more immediate reactions to JB (children, kenosha, wisconsin, but before that: confederate monument debate, money/rich white people ruling US

### Week by week comparative analysis between the topics of popular tweets (PT) and the topics in terms of volume (VOL)

**Week 1**: 
VOL = Diagnostic-oriented: violence, racism, white privilege, Motivation: save lives, justice 
PT = Prognostic: opportunity for change, police weapons, switch systems, defund
**Week 2**: 
VOL and PT = both Diagnostic-oriented -> evidence of violence on protesters, general indignation
**Week 3**:
Both VOL. and PT frames are much more prognostic and motivation-oriented: identification of more specific vulnerable group within the black community (black women, disabled black people), identifications of vectors of change (the educational field, the healthcare system), emphasis on the need for support from external actors and on the need to keep the momentum of the movement
**Week 14**:
VOL = before Jacob Blake’s death = Prognostic-oriented, motivation-oriented: broader topics of discussion and more precise suggestions of solutions (healthcare, elections, voters, “Trump’s America”, voting for Biden, black history, education).
After Jacob Blake’s death (VOL & PT): mostly diagnostic-oriented frames about Jacob, his children, the injustice of the situation and the need to hold the policemen accountable 

## Main conclusion

Following this analysis, we were able to draw some conclusions. First of all, the peaks of engagement of the BLM movement were not necessarily driven by the same motives and did not produce the same kind of frames every time they occurred: we can clearly notice an evolution of the topics that are the most discussed in parallel to the progressive formation and development of the movement.
Snow and Benford conceptualized four aspects of frame alignment (bridging, amplification, extension and transformation), that could all be found in our dataset; 

Bridging connects uninvolved individuals with the movement through common interests and goals. In this case, many of the diagnostic-oriented tweets were meant to rally Black people and allies.

The amplification model is the way a movement expands its core ideas to have a wider, more universal appeal. During the peaks of the BLM and DefundthePolice hashtags, the arguments are extended to encompass the broader notions of social justice, women’s rights, economic inequality, inequal access to healthcare, disabled people.

The extension model occurs when organizations mutually promote each other. This is the case here with the women’s right movements, disabled people’s movements, and the Biden supporters.

Transformation is the revision of the movement’s original goals; when some of its goals succeed (in this case, at first, bringing George Floyd’s killer to justice), there is a risk that it might lose relevance. This concern is very noticeable during the third week, when tweets focus on the need to “keep the momentum”: the movement expands its diagnostic and prognostic frames.

We also noticed a discrepancy between the topics of the most popular tweets and the most popular topics in terms of volume. The general direction went from diagnostic to motivation and prognostic, and back to diagnostic during shocking events, but prognostic-oriented frames kept increasing overall. Interestingly enough, when tweets were more problem-oriented in terms of volume, the popular tweets were the ones that offered solutions. Meanwhile, when most people were talking about possible solutions, the most popular tweets were the most emotional, diagnostic-oriented ones.

This analysis allowed us to get a more precise view of the movement’s dominant frames on Twitter, but it was still limited in scope. We studied the topics that generated the most engagement, but we did not determine the exact type of engagement that occurred each time - which could have been done through a more detailed sentiment analysis, using different tools. Using likes and retweets allowed us to quantify a certain amount of “positive” engagement related to some topics, but the dataset did not include the network of comments and “quote retweets” which are an important part of the Twitter ecosystem. Moreover, the coverage of the popular tweets in news media could also have had an important influence on the framing of the movement on this platform.

#BlackLivesMatter
![qOrAiqCfGDayLeafuARY5NIkbEeiuN8lhzcjK2o0N9X_8293CBTDIEUIs1kEe9ZRbE5CqZHqmeyMa6Mic1dcffEapOZkxvyfHM1qoYvNLBJRuhGCExrIUoRZPSdNNAaGr0nRoJsz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/162241172-2a413e4a-5f9c-48a3-949c-155c2f95b33a.png)

By observing the average number of followers of people who have used the targeted hashtag, several observations can be made. 

The first striking thing is that the curves are extremely fluctuating and essentially show up in spikes of greater or lesser magnitude at more or less regular intervals. The average number of followers is particularly high in early-mid August. This observation leads us to believe that influential or super-influential Twitter accounts engage more or less at the same time. Indeed, the curves should remain more stable if this were not the case, as we are talking about an average per tweeter. However, it could be a matter of a few isolated tweets made by a few very influential people, whereas the engagement of less influential twitter accounts would be less active. This was for example the case on June, 7, when 7 users with more than 1 million followers used the hashtag #DefundThePolice while only 61 of users with less than 1,000 followers did so. The proportion of influential users is then very high, but the number of tweets that day is too low to make statistical conclusions.

Furthermore, from a comparative point of view, it is interesting to note that the orders of magnitude are higher for #DefundThePolice than for #BlackLivesMatter. The peak of the average is reached by #DefundThePolice in early August with almost 1.4 million followers on average per account that tweeted. This is significantly higher than #BlackLivesMatter, whose peak does not reach one million. This leads us to conclude that Twitter accounts relaying #DefundThePolice are generally accounts with more followers. This could be explained by the fact that #BlackLivesMatter is a more mainstream hashtag with a more global and consensual political theme. 

3/ Finally, #DefundThePolice and #BlackLivesMatter do not peak on the same day. 
How to interpret this? 

## Number of tweets containing the hashtag by category of twitters ranked by number of followers.

For both hashtags, the majority of tweets come from the most numerous accounts, those with less than 1000 followers. However, there is a notable difference in terms of proportions. The ratio between the number of tweets published by accounts in the first category and those in the fifth category varies significantly. 1 to 28 for BLM, 1 to 15 for DTP.

For BLM, almost a quarter of the retweets are of tweets from twitters in the fifth category. For RTP, almost a third of retweets are concentrated in the third category.

## Evolution of the volume of tweets by follower base

Black Lives Matter: 
![PSu8scyofz42z8AHsClOPo_nqfvp-_49sF9H5bYQ5a1E-QopZQcvqiahBp3oh0dvAYSRmTRc_wet1OOJ7HJsjR1jKaH-K5GZXBoHEDLoqLlH5NjrdSgXd00RGKSfZlRSRftdWt9x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/162242970-28dbf422-0e6f-4055-833b-4d2f2ea289dd.png)
If we look at the curves for the volume of tweets per day by category of twitters, we can see that all the curves move rather simultaneously, whether we are talking about BLM or DTP. Furthermore, the differences in volume between categories remain proportional. This indicates that one category of twitters does not seem to influence another category more from one day to the next. Since interactions on social media such as Twitter are generally made hour by hour, especially with constant updates of the feed, the results would perhaps be different if the evolution of the volume was observed hour by hour.

## Top 80 most retweeted tweets

We isolated the top 80 most retweeted tweets containing #BlackLivesMatter or #DefundThePolice. We wanted to see what kind of content users were mostly reacting to. We consider retweets rather than likes because retweets induce a higher level of involvement by the users. The results were quite contrasted between the two hashtags. We decided to focus on the most retweeted tweets written by users with more than 1 million followers and those written by users with less than 10,000 followers. The first ones enabled us to determine whether the profiles of influential users change from one hashtag to another. The second ones enabled us to determine what kind of content users were the most responsive depending on the hashtag, provided that the low follower-base of those who tweeted them could not explain the level of their diffusion.

For #DefundThePolice, the users with more than 1 million followers were: Ice Cube, Rex Chapman, LilNasX, Seth Rogen, Jordan Peele, AOC, Casey Frey, Anna Kendrick, Bernie Sanders, Mitt Romney, Ice T,  Trevor Noah, Nicholas Kristof. For #BlackLivesMatter, the users with more than 1 million followers were : BTS, Obama, Taylor Swift, Ice Cube, Rex Chapman, Harry Styles, SpaceX, Jordan Peele, Netflix, Bernie Sanders.

First of all, it is noticeable that for #DefundThePolice, all of them are American persons, except Trevor Noah who is a South-African comedian and political commentator hosting The Daily Show, an american satirical news program on Comedy Central. As for #BlackLivesMatter, some users were not American, BTS (Korean) and Harry Styles (British), and some were actually companies, Netflix and SpaceX. 
Besides, for #DefundThePolice, the personalities have generally been more engaged and more revendicative in defending black communities by the past than for #BlackLivesMatter. This is especially the case of Ice Cube, an African-American rapper or Jordan Peele, an African-American actor and film director. On the contrary, some personalities, such as BTS or Taylor Swift, who have tweeted #BlackLivesMatter can be considered very consensual and not very politicized.
Therefore, we conclude that opinion leaders who tweeted #DefundThePolice are much more politically assertive than those who tweeted #BlackLivesMatter.

Secondly, for the most retweeted tweets written by user with less than 10,000 followers, the results were also contrasted between #BlackLivesMatter and #DefundThePolice. For the former, of the 35 tweets, 17 (49% of them) are visuals, mostly pictures. Some of these pictures deal with broad issues such as racism, equity, justice, white privilege. Others are focused on the protests (picture of peaceful protesters, picture of John Boyega, video of BLM protests in New Zealand, video of protesters shutting down highway to Atlanta) and George Floyd (Video to explain how to help George Floyd’s family, sign of George Floyd’s lasts words. 

The textual tweets often reflect on the legitimacy of the protests : “so can someone explain the controversy behind ending racism? like shouldn’t we all be on board, right? what am i missing?” ; “racist white ppl be like “burning possessions won’t solve the issue” ....didnt y’all burn Nike products when they endorsed Collin Kaepernick’s peaceful protest ?????????????”; “Y’all can understand a white kid shooting up a school cuz he was bullied after 4 months of school but don’t understand why an oppressed group is compelled to burn shit down after 400yrs”

As for #DefundThePolice, the vast majority of tweets are footage of the police being violent. Indeed, of the 24 tweets, 14 (58%) are visuals, mostly videos. All of them show the police being brutal with black people or protesters. Here are the topics covered by the videos in detail. : 5 videos show a black man being arrested by the police; 1 video of the police shooting paint canisters at protesters on their house front porch; 1 video cut of police brutality during the protests contrasting with  a speech from Mayor Garcetti, L.A., supporting the police contrasting; 1 video of a police officer talking to a white man holding a gun on the margins of the protests; 1 video of protesters getting tear-gassed by the police while being cornered; 1 picture of a police officer pointing his flash-ball at a black man carrying his daughter on his shoulders; 1 video of a NYPD car rolling over protesters; 1 video of a woman telling that the police has destroyed their medical tent; 1 video of tribute to Elijah McClain, a black man killed by Aurora PD in 2019; 1 picture of Jamel Leach in hospital, a 16-year-old African-American teenager, having been assaulted by the police; 1 video of policemen emptying bottle of waters of protesters

Therefore, we conclude that, unsurprisingly, #DefundThePolice was most likely spread through visual tweets (58%), all of them showing police brutality, especially against black persons. This was not the case for #BlackLivesMatter, for which more than half (51%) of the most retweeted tweets are textual and deal with the broader issue of racism. 


# Network analysis 

We used the Twitter Explorer to modelize interactions between users, by focusing on quotes notably. We represent the evolution of the network below:

![screenshot (24)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161747930-9ec5f016-460b-4575-af2c-62eba734312e.png)

As we can see on this network analysis, users were initially very decentralized, as time passed, we can see that a core of users with a high degree of connectivity started to shape up. A nebulous of decentralized users remain at the periphery. 
The network throughout the period studied looks like this, on the first figure, it highlights accounts that were counted the most, while on the second it highlights accounts with the most followers: 

![screenshot (49)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161980537-c12c02df-f61d-49e7-b745-eb9f524299ac.png)

The network overall does not seem to be structured around big accounts, but rather around users with the highest degree of connectivity, which are not necessarily those with the most followers, but rather those that have posted videos that elicit a more emotional reaction, as explained above. Within this this dense core, we can see different Leiden communities, which shows a high degree of inter-community interactions. We see a significant proportion of decentralized users that interact with one another and even create small cores. 

![screenshot (51)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161981362-8441a2c7-6bbf-4408-b5d7-73e5ed8029be.png)

This network of hashtags associated with #DefundThePolice reflects the diversity of communities that interact within the #DefundThePolice ecosystem. These communities all contribute to the conversation, which enables the hashtag to broaden the conversation to more local issues such as protests in Portland (#PortlandProtest), but also tackle more social issues such transphobia (#BlackTransLivesMatter), systemic violence perpetrated by immigration services (#AbolishICE). In turn this high degree of connectivity between users enables them to be exposed to this broader conversation. This truly exemplifies the notion of informal learning brought in the literature review. Finally, the contribution of users with a lot of followers, such as celebrities, news media enables to bring into the conversation a broader audience.

We have generated networks with other queries, in order to better highlight the specificities of the #DefundThePolice network. 
In contract, #ReformThePolice displays a more scattered network with little connection between users which is seemingly shaped around these bigger accounts. 
![screenshot (52)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161982679-6ade361c-1245-441c-af1a-eed2859e05d5.png)

The hyper dominance of bigger accounts with #ReformThePolice is further demonstrated by the statistics that we have collected, that show that engagement was very much concentrated within the few bigger accounts that have used the hashtag: 

![NvaD0-proportion-of-engagement-metrics-per-popularity-nbsp-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161983349-db8b4899-a11e-46cb-a065-9f711034ca5e.png)

This results in less hashtags associated with #ReformThePolice, less differentiation among communities and local involvement limited to NYC as it seems:
![screenshot (58)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161983724-a9fb3a3f-2bfd-4a39-9fae-426db8e39dea.png)

As to #AbolishThePolice, we can see the network resembles that of #DefundThePolice, albeit with a less dense core, and fewer users.
![screenshot (56)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161983777-484369b2-3861-4cec-8e44-f5d732de300b.png)

We can also see a variety of topics which focus on local demonstrations and real life event. A difference from #DefundThePolice might be that the hashtag did not really manage to create an overarching narrative. 
![screenshot (57)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102752920/161984104-4c0a09bf-a263-4356-b09a-b0e6d478acbc.png)
