# Methodology 
In order to conduct this analysis on the mainstreaming of police abolition in 2020, we have mainly relied on collecting and analyzing tweets. We looked at trending hashtags that were used to push for specific framing of police violence within the Black Lives Matter movement. 

**Black Lives Matter** :  A decentralized political and social movement that seeks to highlight racism, discrimination, and inequality experienced by black people. 
**Defund The Police**: Advocates reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resource
**Abolish The Police** : Avocates replacing policing with other systems of public safety. Police abolitionists believe that policing, as a system, is inherently flawed and cannot be reformed as it is deeply rooted in a history of white supremacy and settler colonialism
**Reform The Police**: Without questioning the existence of the police, the movement advocates the reorganisation of hierarchical structures, staffing, and the training of police in alternative approaches to law enforcement.

## Sources
We have focused on the summer of 2020, following George Floydâ€™s murder (May 25th to August 31st) and collected tweets with the Twitter Explorer and the Twitter API associated with the following queries to constitute a corpus of tweets: 
#DefundThePolice
#BlackLivesMatter
#ReformThePolice
#AbolishThePolice
We notably used the Twitter Explorer in order to collect and visualize our data. 
 
We have then conducted both quantitative and qualitative analysis on this corpus of tweets, and some degree of network analysis. We were predominantly interested in studying the frames brought by these tweets, their engagement rate, and how these hashtags have performed comparatively.  


## Quantitative analysis
We analyzed Twitter metadata, notably retweet counts, the volume of tweets, co-occurrences of hashtags  and we designed networks to account for interactions between accounts. We also leveraged topic modelling and tf-idf in order to highlight key terms. 

## Qualitative analysis 
We performed critical discourse analysis on the tweets that have received the most engagement from all of our corpus, in order to understand which frames worked best.
