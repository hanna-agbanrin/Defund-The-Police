## Introduction 
Almost two years after the death of George Floyd and the wave of movements calling for more social justice, the idea of a profound reform of the repressive system in the United States has made its way. In 2021, for example, across the US, $840 million was taken away from police while $160 million was spent on life and community investments. Such statistics echo the waves of protests that marked spring and summer 2020, including the ‘Defund the police’ movement.
Defund the police is a slogan that means reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to non-policing forms of public safety and community support, such as social services, youth services, housing, education, healthcare and other community resources. While this idea is not new, it has had a particular resonance from the year 2020. The murder of African-American George Floyd by white police officer Derek Chauvin once again brought the institution of policing into disrepute, while at the same time the country was plunged into a pandemic crisis that highlighted the failure of several social services, foremost among them the health system.
